This is a student ptoject that aims at creating an artificial intelligence able to play the classic game Snake through the application of a neural network.    
The Gihub architecture is as follows :  
• BestMapping contains the .py file with the best artificial intelligence we managed to construct and two directory with the best players we have obtained.  
• HybridMapping is an experimental follow up.  
• IndustrialApplication is a directory containing a .py file that modelizes the use of drone able to get an object and carry it back to it's starting point by using the same Artificial Intelligence as the Snake.
